Extra notes
=======================================================================
- MesaFx 16bit overrides are enabled by default, disable it, for default MesaFx behaviour. 
Or 16bit will be used in all openGl games. This is important, should be used as a fps boost in older openGl games,
specialy Quake 2 engine ones. But for Quake3(for example), no need.

- If your using mostly VGA output, run the extra registry file for 1920x1080.
It will override the timing for this resolution and vga, with the ones provided by 3dfx.
\Extra\Win98\98_Set1080p_vga.reg

- Glide override resolution, was tested with Unreal engine games, it might work for others, or not ...
If it works, FOV has to be adjusted in-game. If default fov is 90 at 4:3, then its 106 for 16:9 and 121 for 21:9.
But fov is a personal prefference.

Game specifics:
- Quake 2: In some cases it will set higher gamma, that will also affect other openGl games. When outside the game,
go to 3dfx tools/gamma settings and move the gamma slider and apply. Move back to 1.3.
- Nfs5 - Green-ish smoke when burning rubber, force 32bit glide rendering in 3dfx tools.
- Unreal tournament - Glide running slower than other APIs. Glide has some extra settings enabled by default.
Open console "~", enter "preferences", it will open advanced settings. Under Glide disable Detail textures and Volumetric lights.
